## Introduction :wave:

The Hacker's Toolkit is a collection of common ports and services often exploited by hackers for various purposes. As a security enthusiast or IT professional, it's essential to be aware of these ports and their vulnerabilities to safeguard your systems and networks. :shield:

## Ports Used by Hackers :electric_plug:

1. **Port 21 - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** :floppy_disk:
   - Description: FTP is commonly used for transferring files between systems. Hackers may target insecure FTP configurations to gain unauthorized access to files or upload malicious content.

2. **Port 22 - Secure Shell (SSH)** :closed_lock_with_key:
   - Description: SSH provides secure remote access to systems. Hackers might attempt to exploit weak credentials or vulnerabilities in SSH to gain unauthorized access to servers.

3. **Port 23 - Telnet** :computer:
   - Description: Telnet is a legacy protocol used for remote terminal access. Due to its lack of encryption, hackers can potentially intercept sensitive data transmitted via Telnet.

4. **Port 25 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** :envelope_with_arrow:
   - Description: SMTP is used for sending emails between mail servers. Hackers may target SMTP to relay spam or perform email-based attacks.

5. **Port 53 - Domain Name System (DNS)** :globe_with_meridians:
   - Description: DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. DNS vulnerabilities can be exploited to redirect users to malicious websites or perform DNS amplification attacks.

6. **Port 69 - Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)** :pager:
   - Description: TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol. It lacks authentication, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

7. **Ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443 - HTTP/HTTPS** :globe_with_meridians:
   - Description: HTTP is used for web communication, while HTTPS provides secure encrypted communication. Hackers often target web applications and services on these ports to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.

8. **Port 135 - Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** :gear:
   - Description: RPC is a protocol used for communication between Windows systems. Hackers might exploit vulnerabilities in RPC to execute arbitrary code remotely.
